            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>This game was created for Global Game Jam 2020. Based on the theme of 'Repair'. </p>
            <p>Going in to this game jam as a pair we knew what we wanted to make. We just needed a way to make the game fit the theme of the game jam. We had laid out our plans for the game jam
                on a whiteboard so that we could tick off the tasks as we went. This proved helpful and we ended up reaching most of the goals we set out for ourselves. 
                <br><br>For this game I did the bulk of the programming, though some of the elements such as the lobby system were programmed by my partner.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this game is to be the last player standing. 
                The first part of the game requires the player to use their pickaxe to collect resources, which they can then sell. with the money they can visit the shop and buy weapons.
                <br><br>
                At this point in the game the players must try to kill each other, however with each player having their own personal gravity this can prove difficult. Once there is one player left the round is over.
                <br><br>
                The game ends once one player has won four rounds, having successfully built their rocket they can escape the doomed planet.
