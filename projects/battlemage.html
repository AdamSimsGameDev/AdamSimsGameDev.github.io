                "You are an explorer travelling the world, encountering enemies as you go. In order to progress you must kill the enemies using magic, weapons and items in this turn-based game. You earn money and items as you go, upgrading your weapons, spells and armour in order to take on bigger and badder enemies. If you die however, you must take over as your successor with nothing but your fatherâ€™s gold to help you."

            <p class="info">This game was created for the Search For A Star X programming challenge. It was created over the course of a month based on pre-existing code. </p>
            <p class="info">The goal for the challenge was to take pre-existing code and build upon it to create your own full game. 
                We were given a game in which the character would move around based on where the player clicked in the world using A* pathfinding.
                The world generation code we were given was random, so I wanted to keep the randomness of the world generation in my game.</p>
            <p> class="info"I decided to base my design on a few games. The first was XCOM, the movement system reminded me heavily of it. 
                Because of this I wanted to create a game where the player had to clear a level of enemies.
                Also, I loved the simplicity of the user interface in the Fire Emblem games, so I wanted some UI similar to that.</p>
            <p class="info">Due to all of these factors, and my love for the rougelike genre I wanted to create a rougelike game in which the player has to kill all of the enemies to progress.</p>

            <p class="info">
                The goal for this game is to progress as far as you can in the world. 
                The player must kill enemies, sell what they loot and progressively get better equipment so that they stand a chance against ever increasing threat.
                <br><br>
                Once a stage is completed the player can visit the shop, buying spells, weapons, consumables and armour and selling the loot that they find.
                From the world map the player can also manage their spells, which allows them to adjust the skills they will bring to a fight.
