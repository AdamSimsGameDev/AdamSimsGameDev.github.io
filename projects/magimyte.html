            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>This game was created for a university ran game jam called <i>Movember Jam</i>. It was developed over the course of 48 hours.</p>
            <p>For this jam we were given the theme <i>60 seconds</i>. I took this literally and wanted to produce a game that would take place over the course of 60 seconds.</p>
            <p>Because of my love for top down games I wanted the game to be from that perspective, and I wanted to use a non conventional damage system, so I chose knockback.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The goal of the game is to be the player holding the bomb at the end of the 60 second timer. In order to do this you need to make contact with it whilst it is on the ground.
                If the player is hit by a projectile fired by another player the bomb is dropped and has to be recollected. If a player falls of the edge they will respawn after a short period of time.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the 60 seconds, the players are given the option to select an powerup from the center of the level, however the players are only spawned in based on who touched the bomb last.
                This gives the winner of the last round the choice over what powerup they choose.
